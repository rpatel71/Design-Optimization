results that we got from using different initial guesses, we can say that there is not much of a difference in calculation of the results, though method is the same, the precision of the answer is slightly changing, however considering its precision which is 10^-5 can be negligible. This trend seems to be only affecting the digits with the precision of 10^-5. So, as it is percieved here, changing the initial guesses will not make a significant impact to the solution at all.
